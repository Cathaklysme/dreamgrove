{{/* 

Currently .Next and .NextInSection go in opposite directions. This makes the ordering of section lists
appear opposite to what the ordering of these next and previous links do.

For now as a workaround, we can switch the two links to point to the other. Leaving this comment as a note
to myself for whenever this bug is fixed in Hugo.
