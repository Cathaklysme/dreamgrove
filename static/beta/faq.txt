1. What's new?
    * Changes from the September 2nd build 9.0.1.35755 are included.
    * Further optimization may be possible to the APL. If you discover an improvement, please submit a report.
    * Any changes to spell selection for Convoke the Spirits remains to be investigated.
    * All profiles now include 3 conduits: the covenant one (except kyrian), Fury of the Skies, and Precise Alignment.
    * With Starlord, you will want to `/cancelaura` when you:
        * Have less than 6 seconds remaining on the buff
        * Enter a new Eclipse
        * Have 90+ AP or are using BoAT
    * Pool for 90+ AP before casting Celestial Alingment/Incarnation. ***This also applies to the opener***.
    * Kyrian makes more effective alignment of Kindred Spirits & Balance of All Things crit buff.
    * The following consumables are used:
        * Celestial Guidance weapon enchant
        * Feast of Gluttonous Hedonism
        * Flask of Spectral Power
        * Potion of Sectral Intellect
    * Add '1T Move' selection for approximation of random light movement.
    * Rename 'M+' to 'Dungeon' and add movement events.
    * Base profile has been updated, see question below.

1. What are the base stats used in the sims?
    * The base profile can be found in [sandbag.txt](sandbag.txt)
    * All items are from Mythic Castle Nathira, except for placeholder trinkets
    * Full 6 mastery gems are socketted
    * No gear has extra ilevel for being legendary

1. What is the '1T Move' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is a ***LARGELY UNOPTIMIZED APPROXIMATION*** of a light movement encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [move.txt](move.txt). It consists of:
        * Each movement has a random distance of 20yd to 30yd
        * Movement starts when boss health reaches 95%
        * Movement repeats every ~30s to ~60s
    * There is no optimization of pooling and planning for movement
    * Fallback casts during movement are:
        * Starsurge if Balance of All Things is not equipped
        * Sunfire and Moonfire, starting with the lowest remaining duration

1. What is the 'Dungeon' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an ***UNOPTIMIZED, VERY CRUDE APPROXIMATION*** of a random dungeon-like encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [mplus.txt](mplus.txt). It consists of:
        * Random light movement as per the '1T Move' script
        * ~450s total fight time
        * ~130s to ~150s fighting one mob
        * ~30s to ~50s fighting a wave of 3 to 7 mobs, each wave random and repeating until the end of the fight
        * Random 0s to ~20s wait after each fight

1. What about conduits?
    * All sims include the covenant specific conduits (except for Kyrian), Fury of the Skies, and Precise Alignment conduits at base rank.
    * Umbral Intesity and Stellar Inspiration at current tuning contribute less than 1% and are not worth simming.
    * The Kyrian conduit can desync Kindred Spirits from other CDs so is not worth simming.

1. What about soulbinds?
    * As the value of different soulbind paths depend on the relative value of traits versus the conduit sockets, soulbinds will be included once it is known what rank of conduits will be available during the first tier.

1. How does SimC handle Convoke the Spirits (Night Fae)?
    * SimC assumes it will cast ~3.5 healing spells, 1 Starfall if it isn't up, 1 Moonfire if you have a target without it, at least 1 Wrath, then roughly balance out the remaining between Starsurge, Wrath, and Moonfire on any further un-dotted targets.

1. How does SimC handle Kindred Spirits (Kyrian)?
    * SimC assumes that you are bonding with someone who does the exact same damage as you. The additional damage done by you AND your partner are attributed to you.

1. What about bugs on the Beta/PTR? Which are assumed to be fixed for the sims?
    * Moons correctly benefit from nature buffs such as Solar Eclipse, Balance of All Things nature crit buff.
    * Endless Thirst conduit correctly provides 2% crit per stack.
    * The Balance of All Things crit buffs correctly applies to any queued instant spell that follows the wrath/starfire that procs Eclipse.
    * Feast of Gluttonous Hedonism grants 72 Intellect as per the tooltip instead of giving the same buff as the BFA feast.

1. Are the sims updated for _____ ?
    * At the top of the HTML report, in the SimulationCraft banner, you will find the git build code.
    * Goto `http://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/commits/<enter git build code here>` to see all the changes to SimC that have been incorporated into the sim.

1. How can I run my own beta sims?
    * Full instructions for building SimC can be found in the SimC wiki <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/HowToBuild" target="_top">HowToBuild</a> page.
    * Instructions on creating the command line version and how to use it can be found in [how_to_build.txt](how_to_build.txt)
    * A copy of the command line program can be found as `simc_(date).rar` but this can often be outdated.

1. How do I sim a covenant?
    * Add the line **covenant=covenant_name**

1. How do I sim a conduit?
    * Add the line **soulbind=conduit_name:rank/conduit2_name:rank/...**

1. How do I sim a legendary?
    * Legendary effects are added to gear as a bonus_id. Add the line for a tabard with the legendary effect from [leg_x_cov.txt](leg_x_cov.txt)

1. How can I see past sims to see how we've been nerfed/buffed?
    * With the BETA state of Shadowlands and things constantly in development, we can't easily show pre-/post- sims. This may change during the major patches once Shadowlands goes live.
