Tanking trinkets in BFA suck for survivability.

That’s fine, you probably shouldn’t be relying on your trinkets to survive anyway.

Remember that your main stat is good defensively in this expansion, and take whatever high item level trinkets with your main stat as the base stat that you can. Also remember that for survivability, on-use and flat stat gains are generally better than procs. You may want to consider just picking any trinket with base main stat that is good for DPS in your spec.

There is one trinket which is reasonably good for tanking. It’s your main stat + versatility on use:

For Death Knights, Warriors and Paladins, this trinket is {{< item 159627 "Jes' Howler" >}}, which drops from Tol Dagor.

For Druids, Monks, and Demon Hunters, this trinket is {{< item 159617 "Lustrous Golden Plumage" >}}, which drops from King’s Rest.

{{< item 159128 "Darkmoon Deck: Blockades" >}} deserves a special mention because it’s exceptionally bad. The effect of the trinket is unbelievably small (so much so that you may expect it to be enormously buffed, but don’t count on it). The main stat on it is still good, and it’s quite a high item level compared to other pre-raid trinkets, so you may want to consider buying it if it’s particularly cheap despite the effect of the trinket itself being completely and utterly negligible.

{{< item 159125 "Darkmoon Deck: Fathoms" >}} deserves a special mention because it’s basically just a main stat trinket with no secondary effect, as far as tanking is concerned - i.e. identical to {{< item 159128 "Blockades" >}} - but is extremely good for damage done. It’s usually much more expensive (and for good reason). You can use both.

I'm sure there will be better ones later in the expansion.
