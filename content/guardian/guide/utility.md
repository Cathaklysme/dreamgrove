{{< spell 106839 "Skull Bash" >}} – your basic interrupt. Can be used from slightly-further-than-melee-range away from the target (and more, if using {{< spell 197632 "Balance Affinity" >}}).

{{< spell 99 "Incapacitating Roar" >}} – This is an aoe disorient. This is especially useful for stopping enemies from casting when you can’t ordinarily interrupt them, or when there are too many to interrupt all the casts. Note that if you have both the talent {{< spell 204012 "Guttural Roars" >}} and {{< spell 197488 "Balance Affinity" >}}, the range of this ability is enormous, and it can pull enemies from places you were not expecting.

{{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} – Very useful ability in certain raid encounters; and just generally good to have in dungeons.

{{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" >}} (talent) – Single target stun.

{{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} (talent) – AoE knockback; particularly useful for dungeons where you need to kite the enemies.

{{< spell 102359 "Mass Entanglement" >}} (talent) – AoE root. Usually not very good, in certain specific situations it can be very useful, such as on Coven of Shivarra or Aggramar, both from the Antorus raid.

{{< spell 20484 "Rebirth" >}} – Combat resurrection.

{{< spell 5215 "Prowl" >}} – Stealth. Can be useful in some dungeons.

{{< spell 1850 "Dash" >}} – Makes you enter cat form and gives you high movement speed whilst in cat form. You do not need to be in cat form to cast it in the first place.

{{< spell 2908 "Soothe" >}} - Dispels all enrage effects on a single enemy. This is particularly useful in dungeons, as there are a lot of enrage effects in BfA dungeons and especially against the mythic+ affix Raging, which is dispellable.
