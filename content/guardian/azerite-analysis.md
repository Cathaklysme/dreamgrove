Azerite powers are a new system in Battle for Azeroth, similar to the Netherlight Crucible from Legion. They provide various bonuses and augment your skills in ways similar to tier set bonuses or legendaries, but at a slightly lower power level.

Let's take a look at the traits available to Guardians. I'm going to focus today on only the subset of traits specific to the Guardian spec (and traits shared between Guardian and Feral), as they are the most relevant to this post. Keep in mind that this is a small subset of all available traits, and some are likely to be stronger than the Guardian specific traits in either offense or defense. 

You are always guaranteed at least one Guardian specific trait on any azerite piece (in some cases it's possible to have two, if Wild Fleshrending is present).

Because some of the effects on the traits scale with item level, I will be assuming an item level of 370 (Heroic Uldir) for all trait values.

# Druid Traits

The following traits are available only to Druids. Most of these are Guardian specific, but some are shared between Feral and Balance as well. You are guaranteed at least one Guardian specific trait and one generic trait on every azerite piece, although it is possible to have more if one of the shared traits is present for another spec.

## Craggy Bark

{{< spell 276157 "Craggy Bark" >}} - {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} reduces melee attacks against you by X damage.

At 370, the value of the reduction is 362 damage per melee. If we assume a standardized enemy swing timer of 2 seconds per melee, with a {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} duration of 12 seconds you will reduce 6 melees per use, per enemy. That's a total reduction of 2172 (give or take a few points due to rounding) damage per Barkskin, per target. This effect occurrs after mitigation.

Frankly, this trait is pretty terrible. Not only is it only active during Barkskin when you already have a 10% damage reduction going, but the amount that it reduces is not especially meaningful *and* it only works on melee attacks. Unless this trait is buffed, I'd recommend avoiding it where possible. 

## Gory Regeneration

{{< spell 279536 "Gory Regeneration" >}} - {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} increases the duration of an active {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} by 1 second. Additionally, Frenzied Regeneration heals for X more per second.

At 370 the extra heal is valued at 524 extra healing per second, for a total of 2096 additional healing per cast. This extra healing is present regardless of whether the FR is empowered by Mangle or not. Additionally, the extension occurs *per target hit*, meaning that if you have {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}} and you can hit 3 targets with Mangle, you will get 3 seconds of extension per cast. That in addition to the cooldown of Mangle being reduced means you can sustain an FR for a very long time while Incarnation is active.

This trait basically lives or dies by whether or not you're talented into Incarnation. If you aren't, Mangle's cooldown is so long that you will get at most 1 second of extension (you can get 2 in theory if you have around 88% haste, which may be possible with lust/berserking and a lot of haste rating). If you are, this trait becomes an incredibly powerful boost to your self-healing capabilities. 

That being said, while this trait looks very good (under certain circumstances) on paper, I'm not convinced it has the same value in practice. For one, the HPS of Frenzied Regeneration is still quite low, at 6% HP per tick, baseline. The extension component of Gory Regeneration does not improve the HPS output at all, it merely prolongs its duration. This would be fine in isolation, but in reality you don't have infinite health and you will have external healing. Extending FR increases the chance that it will cause overhealing, either for you or for your healers, which eliminates the benefit of receiving more healing altogether.
