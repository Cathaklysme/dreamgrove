## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,212,213,113,131,132,213" >}}

## Playstyle

In Phase 1, G'huun's adds deal primarily melee damage. In Phase 2, G'huun himself deals approximately 50% melee damage, 50% plague damage.

In Phase 1 there is no forced tank swap. Tank the Dark Young on top of any groups of Cyclopean Horrors.

In Phase 2 and 3, the forced tank swap is {{< spell 270447 "Growing Corruption" >}}, which stacks every time G'huun melees the same target in a row. Growing Corruption increases the damage of {{< spell 270443 "Corrupting Bite" >}}, which accompanies every melee attack. Stacks are reset when G'huun melees a new target. The off-tank will be tanking any Gibbering Horrors that are active.

### Mythic

Mythic G'huun was not tested, so we are unsure how the mechanics are intended to work. However, as far as changes relevant to tanking go:

- Gibbering Horrors can only permanently die during Reorigination Blast.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} to assist the raid's movement during {{< spell 270428 "Wave of Corruption" >}}.
