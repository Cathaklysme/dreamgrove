description: Recommendations for Guardian Druid talents, and playstyle, and tips and tricks for Fetid Devourer in Uldir, on Normal/Heroic and Mythic difficulties.

## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,212,123,113,311,213,213" >}}

## Playstyle

Fetid Devourer deals entirely Physical damage, almost entirely from melees (or Terrible Thrash {{< spell 262277 "Terrible Thrash" >}}).

There is no forced tank swap on this fight. This encounter does require two tanks due to {{< spell 262277 "Terrible Thrash" >}} --- every fourth melee, the boss will attack the nearest person to the tank for 300% of a normal melee. The two tanks must be on top of each other at all times. {{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}} *does not* work against Terrible Thrash.

When the Corruption Corpuscles spawn, it may be optimal to drag the boss to one of them to maximize cleave. Otherwise, tank the boss in the center of the room to minimize travel time.

**Catweavable**: No

### Mythic

It is recommended that the boss be dragged on top of the Mutated Mass for maximum DPS.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during {{< spell 262288 "Shockwave Stomp" >}} to help the raid manage their movement, or when Corruption Corpuscles spawn.
