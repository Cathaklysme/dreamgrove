This section of the guide will explain the basics of Mythic+ as a Balance Druid. Moonkin brings a lot to the table in Mythic+ and is a viable caster at all levels of keys. Our main strengths come from sustained multi-target, a plethora of utility, consistent defensives, and very little loss of single target damage from talenting full AoE compared to other dps. 

### Talents 

The generic talents you would take in Mythic+ are: 

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="003,003,003,003,003,030,030" >}}

Notable Alternative Talents and When to Use Them

#### Tier 15: 

- {{< spell 202430 "Nature’s Balance" "beta" >}} can be the strongest throughput of the entire row if the dungeon has a high amount of downtime in between packs and bosses so that you can benefit from the recharge out of combat.

- {{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" "beta" >}} is the general damage talent when you don’t need treants as it offers ample burst on demand and can help deal with heavy movement.

#### Tier 45:

- {{< spell 197491 "Guardian Affinity" "beta" >}} could prove useful if it's required to negate a one shot, otherwise {{< spell 197492 "Restoration Affinity" "beta" >}} is generally better.

#### Tier 60:

- {{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" "beta" >}} can come in handy when there are extremely dangerous singular mobs that aren’t affected by knockbacks and they need to be dealt with.

#### Tier 100: 

- {{< spell 202342 "Shooting Stars" "beta" >}} can be taken over {{< spell 202770 "Fury of Elune" "beta" >}} in dungeons where there are many spread out adds. Also, if the dungeon is low level and trash dies before you get a chance to ramp, this could be useful just for higher single target damage on bosses.

### Utility

As a Balance Druid it is vital you capitalize on your very useful utility. {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" "beta" >}} and FoN will make you the tanks best friend, assisting them in moving mobs out of Sanguine or other mechanics, and helping them kite or stay alive in general. Dispelling enrage effects (even the Raging affix) with {{< spell 2908 "Soothe" "beta" >}} will keep your tank and groups health much more stable and {{< spell 2637 "Hibernate" "beta" >}} can even be used to completely take a mob and therefore a mechanic out of the fight, making everyone's lives much easier. {{< spell 78675 "Solar Beam" "beta" >}} can completely shut down the threat of an entire group of trash when timed correctly. It’s worth noting a Moonkin also brings a battle rez in the form of {{< spell 20484 "Rebirth" "beta" >}} as it is important you have at least one battle rez in a Mythic+ group.

### Azerite Traits

In Battle for Azeroth, the gear you have equipped once the key begins is the gear you will have throughout the entire dungeon, so it is crucial you prepare accordingly and choose the best Azerite pieces for the job. The Azerite traits that you choose should be determined based on your group composition, the dungeon itself, and affixes. You should try to cover the weaknesses of you group as much as possible.

- {{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" "beta" >}} - The safe Azerite trait in pugs and or high density dungeons where you are doing huge pulls, being easy to use and effective, requiring little communication to pull off. Lunar Shrapnel will leave your single target something to be desired, but it’s worth it for the massive payoff.

- {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} - A more niche option, offering quick constant burst for affixes like Explosive. Power of the Moon could possibly be powerful in dungeons where there is a medium amount of trash and/or even bosses that include 2 target cleave.

- {{< spell 279646 "Lively Spirit" "beta" >}} - Though Lively Spirit requires more communication, it can be potent for burst in both single target and multi-target, granting both decent multi-target and single target damage overall unlike most of our considerable Mythic+ traits and easily being our best trait. It is not recommended to use this trait in pugs. 

- {{< spell 280555 "Archive of the Titans" "beta" >}} - The recommended trait to use if you can't take advantage of Lively Spirit. Archive is a nice mix of single target and multi-target while also being sustained. 

- Stat Increasing Traits - Generic Stat increasing traits such as {{< spell 280429 "Swirling Sands" "beta" >}} or {{< spell 273823 "Blightborne Infusion" "beta" >}} can be a decent choice especially if you lack the prior listed traits. These traits much like Lively Spirit act as a mix of single target and multi-target, but don't require communication.

### Trinkets

As it stands there is no trinket that is notably special for Mythic+. That being said, it is recommended you take trinkets that are both strong on multi-target and single target if you have the choice. Simming your character will generally give the best results in figuring out your trinket choice.
