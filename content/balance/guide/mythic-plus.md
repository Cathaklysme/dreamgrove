This section of the guide will explain the basics of Mythic+ as a Balance Druid. Moonkin brings a lot to the table in Mythic+ and is a viable caster at all levels of keys. Our main strengths come from sustained multi-target, a plethora of utility, consistent defensives, and very little loss of single target damage from talenting full AoE compared to other dps. 

### Talents 

The generic talents you would take in Mythic+ are:

Notable Alternative Talents and When to Use Them

#### Tier 15: 

- Nature’s Balance can be the strongest throughput of the entire row if the dungeon has a high amount of downtime in between packs and bosses so that you can benefit from the recharge out of combat.

- Warrior of Elune is the general damage talent when you don’t need treants as it offers ample burst on demand and can help deal with heavy movement.

#### Tier 45:

- Restoration Affinity is potentially very helpful in certain dungeons as sometimes it can be difficult for your healer to keep the group alive. Even though it will cost you some damage, a quick Swiftmend can easily save someone's life. Likewise, a group wide Wild Growth can give the healer a bit more time to deal with incoming damage.

#### Tier 60:

- Mighty Bash can come in handy when there are extremely dangerous mobs that aren’t affected by knockbacks and need to be dealt with.

#### Tier 75: 

- Starlord can be a viable choice in a low mob count dungeon. If taking this talent, no Astral Power should be spent within the last 5 seconds of the Starlord buff and pooling Astral Power is of more importance than usual as quickly gaining 2 stacks of Starlord is very solid in terms of damage.

#### Tier 90:

- Stellar Drift could potentially be worth taking if the dungeon has low trash density and a very high amount of movement.

#### Tier 100: 

- Shooting Stars can be taken over FoE in dungeons where there are many spread out adds.

### Utility

As a Balance Druid it is vital you capitalize on your very useful utility. Typhoon and FoN will make you the tanks best friend, assisting them in moving mobs out of Sanguine or other mechanics, and helping them kite or stay alive in general. Dispelling enrage effects with Soothe will keep your tank and groups health much more stable and Hibernate can even be used to completely take a mob and therefore a mechanic out of the fight, making everyone's lives much easier.

### Azerite Traits

In Battle for Azeroth, the gear you have equipped once the key begins is the gear you will have throughout the entire dungeon, so it is crucial you prepare accordingly and choose the best Azerite pieces for the job. Currently there are 3 Azerite traits that stick out in Mythic+.

- Lunar Shrapnel - This will be the general go-to Azerite in pugs and high density dungeons, being easy to use and effective, requiring little communication to pull off. Lunar Shrapnel will leave your single target something to be desired, but it’s worth it for the massive payoff.

- Lively Spirit - Lively Spirit can be highly effective in a cohesive group. Being one of our strongest single targets and multi-target traits. With good communication and planning you can use Lively Spirit to deal ludicrous burst damage.

- Power of the Moon - A more niche option, offering quick constant burst for affixes like Explosive. Possibly Power of the Moon could be powerful in dungeons where there are little amounts of trash and/or even bosses that include 2 target cleave..
