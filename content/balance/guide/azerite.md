Like other gear, Azerite gear should be simmed, just because a piece of gear has your best trait doesn’t mean it is an upgrade. Use logic when choosing between Azerite pieces as well, just because a trait sims less doesn’t mean it is worse if it gives more burst for example. When choosing between defensive vs. offensive Azerite, weigh how important survivability is and if it is needed. This can not be properly explained in a guide as these situations are much too specific.

### Balance Druid Traits 

- {{< spell 276153 "Dawning Sun" "beta" >}} - {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "beta" >}} increases the damage of all {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}}s within the next 8 seconds.

- {{< spell 274398 "Sunblaze" "beta" >}} - Causes Solar Wrath to increase the damage of {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}}. 

- {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" "beta" >}} - During {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "beta" >}} or {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "beta" >}} every non repeated spell inflicts bonus damage upon the target once it strikes them.

- {{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" "beta" >}} - Enemies with {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} applied who are hit by {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "beta" >}} pulse damage to themselves and enemies around them. 

- {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} - The direct damage of {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} does additional damage and has a 5% chance to generate a Lunar Empowerment.

- {{< spell 279070 "High Noon" "beta" >}} - The direct damage of {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}} is increased and Sunfire gains a 3 yard radius increase. 


### Notable General/Non-Balance Specific Azerite Traits

- {{< spell 280559 "Laser Matrix" "beta" >}} - Laser Matrix causes your spells and abilities to shoot a blast of lasers, dealing split damage and healing friendly targets. Also enables Reorigination Array while within Uldir, increasing your highest secondary stat depending on how many bosses you have slain.

- {{< spell 280555 "Archive of the Titans" "beta" >}} - Archive of the Titans will increase your Intellect by 12 every 5 seconds until reaching its max stacks of 20. Activates Reorigination Array.

- {{< spell 279647 "Lively Spirit" "beta" >}} - Causes your {{< spell 29166 "Innervate" "beta" >}} to grant a stack of Intellect for 20 seconds for each spell cast by the healer.


### Stacking Traits

Stacking traits tends to be the way to go as Balance Druid as we don’t lose much, if any damage from stacking multiple of the same effect. In fact, stacking the same Azerite traits can exponentially increase your damage per trait and even change the basic rotation of Moonkin. Percent chances such as the 5% empowerment chance on {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} do not stack with multiple traits, but the damage of a trait or the stat gain of a trait will.


### Rotation/Talent Changing Traits

- {{< spell 276153 "Dawning Sun" "beta" >}} - Slightly alters the rotation by incentivizing you to always have the 8 second buff up before casting {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}}s, even if the {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "beta" >}} is unempowered.

- {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" "beta" >}} - Besides the obvious gameplay change of not repeating the same ability twice in a row, it’s worth noting that you should cast a {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}} after every ability (besides Solar Wrath) unless it would cause you to overcap Astral Power or Empowerments. 

Keep in mind that while Streaking Stars affects abilities such as {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 202770 "Fury of Elune" "beta" >}}, it is only the first tick of the ability. Also, this trait has a reduced amount of damage in conjunction with Incarnation: Chosen of Elune (so Streaking Stars doesn’t make Incarnation a more viable pick).

- {{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" "beta" >}} - Lunar Shrapnel increases the value of Astral Power, leading to {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 202430 "Nature’s Balance" "beta" >}} becoming stronger talent choices due to more Astral Power to spend on Starfalls.

- {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} - Opens up the possibility of spamming {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} on 2-4 targets. {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "beta" >}} also gains power in the tier 75 row, becoming the best of the three due to the other two relying on Astral Power generation to get great effect, something Moonfire spam lacks. Nature’s Balance gains some leeway as well since the other options lose strength in multi-target or just aren’t worth as much since Moonfire hits so hard and taking them would mean less Moonfires. For more info on the Moonfire spam rotation, see the Rotation section.


### Top Traits

This is a list of our most potent traits, ones that you should seek out if you can as they dramatically improve a Balance Druids performance in the correct scenario.	

- {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" "beta" >}} - Being one of our top single target traits and offering decent burst, this level of burst can be invaluable in raids especially if there is a period of damage amplification, a target needs to die fast, or the kill time lines up nicely with our cooldowns.

- {{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" "beta" >}} - A niche, yet powerful trait in the right situation. At 4+ targets Lunar Shrapnel becomes our best trait and only scales more and more with enemies. If an encounter calls for as much multi-target damage as you can push and there are many targets to hit, this should be in your mind when choosing your Azerite gear.

- {{< spell 280559 "Laser Matrix" "beta" >}} - Laser Matrix is a decent trait on single target and mediocre on multi-target, but also activates Reorigination Array in Uldir. This buff will eventually be awarding us with up to 750 of our highest secondary stat, easily surpassing other traits in damage at this point. You should strive to have at least one of Laser Matrix or Archive of the Titans while in Uldir.

- {{< spell 280555 "Archive of the Titans" "beta" >}} - Like Laser Matrix, Archive is a decent trait on single target, and quite good on multi-target. Activating Reorigination Array means having at least one of this trait or Laser Matrix is a must have in Uldir, especially when Reorigination Array is fully stacked.

-{{< spell 279647 "Lively Spirit" "beta" >}} - Assuming you can achieve 9 stacks of Lively Spirit per cast, it is similar to Streaking Stars in power, but comes with the bonus of scaling with multiple targets. Lively Spirit is not for everyone, as it can't be expected for you to be able to use {{< spell 29166 "Innervate" "beta" >}} for your own personal damage, but when you can use Lively, it is an exceptional trait.
