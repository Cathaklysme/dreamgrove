Like other gear, Azerite gear should be simmed, just because a piece of gear has your best trait doesn’t mean it is an upgrade. Use logic when choosing between Azerite pieces as well, just because a trait sims less doesn’t mean it is worse if it gives more burst for example. When choosing between defensive vs. offensive Azerite, weigh how important survivability is and if it is needed. This can not be properly explained in a guide as these situations are much too specific.

### Balance Druid Traits 

- {{< spell 276153 "Dawning Sun" "beta" >}} - {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "beta" >}} increases the damage of all {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}}s within the next 8 seconds. There is nothing special about Dawning Sun, only increasing the damage of your filler spell and spicing up the rotation slightly.

- {{< spell 274398 "Sunblaze" "beta" >}} - Causes Solar Wrath to increase the damage of {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}}. This trait does not scale with more targets in any way. In a niche encounter where you need constant single target priority damage, Sunblaze could be useful.

- {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" "beta" >}} - During {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "beta" >}} or {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "beta" >}}, every non repeated spell inflicts bonus damage upon the target. A pure single target Azerite trait, allowing for crazy burst during cooldowns. It is important to note this trait does not work with spells such as {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "beta" >}} and does not gain more power from Incarnation: Chosen of Elune as the damage of Streaking Stars is reduced when talented into it. 

- {{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" "beta" >}} - Enemies with {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} applied who are hit by Starfall pulse damage to themselves and enemies around them. Lunar Shrapnel’s damage scales exponentially, possibly proving useful on large groups of stacked mobs, but at the loss of single target damage.

- {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} - The direct damage of {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} does additional damage and has a 5% chance to generate a Lunar Empowerment. Power of the Moon changes the rotation by making spamming Moonfire worth it on 2 or 3 targets. For more information on Moonfire spam, look in the Rotation section.

- {{< spell 279070 "High Noon" "beta" >}} - The direct damage and DoT effect of {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}} is increased and Sunfire gains a 3 yard radius increase. Similar to {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}}, High Noon has the possibility of making you spam Sunfire on a single target, resulting in no loss of damage through movement. For more information on Sunfire spam, look in the Rotation section.

### Notable General/Non-Balance Specific Azerite Traits

- {{< spell 280559 "Laser Matrix" "beta" >}} - Laser Matrix causes your spells and abilities to shoot a blast of lasers, dealing split damage and healing friendly targets. It is safe to say this trait is going to be highly desired as it also actives Reorigination Array, a passive buff in Uldir that gives you a huge amount of your most plentiful secondary stat based on how many bosses in Uldir you have slain.  

- {{< spell 279642 "Lively Spirit" "beta" >}} - Awards you with an impressive amount of intellect based on how many spells the healer you {{< spell 29166 "Innervate" "beta" >}} casts, lasting 20 seconds. Albeit more complicated to pull off, Lively Spirit has a reward for using it correctly, granting high damage burst similar to Streaking Stars on both single target and multi-target.

### Recommended Azerite Traits to Look out For

#### Single Target

{{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 279642 "Lively Spirit" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 280383 "Thunderous Blast" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 280285 "Dagger in the Back" "beta" >}}, and {{< spell 280559 "Laser Matrix" "beta" >}} (especially when inside of Uldir) are all traits you should be aiming for. These traits perform well on single target by a considerable amount over other competitors. Lively Spirit and Streaking Stars specifically offer powerful burst that could be invaluable in certain environments. Thunderous Blast and Dagger in the Back do good damage and can definitely be useful traits to have if you obtain high item level pieces. 

#### Multi-Target

{{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 279642 "Lively Spirit" "beta" >}}, and {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} stand out on multi-target above the rest in raw throughput and should be sought after for multi-target. Lively Spirit like on single target can award high damage multi-target burst if used correctly. Power of the Moon and Lunar Shrapnel will deal consistent strong damage on 2-3 targets and 4+ targets respectively.
