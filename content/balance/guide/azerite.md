Like other gear, Azerite gear should be simmed, just because a piece of gear has your best trait doesn’t mean it is an upgrade. Use logic when choosing between Azerite pieces as well, just because a trait sims less doesn’t mean it is worse if it gives more burst for example. When choosing between defensive vs. offensive Azerite, weigh how important survivability is and if it is needed. This can not be properly explained in a guide as these situations are much too specific.

### Balance Druid Traits 

- {{< spell 276153 "Dawning Sun" "beta" >}} - {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "beta" >}} increases the damage of all {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}}s within the next 8 seconds.

- {{< spell 274398 "Sunblaze" "beta" >}} - Causes Solar Wrath to increase the damage of {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}}. 

- {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" "beta" >}} - During {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "beta" >}} or {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "beta" >}} every non repeated spell inflicts bonus damage upon the target. 

- {{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" "beta" >}} - Enemies with {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} applied who are hit by {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "beta" >}} pulse damage to themselves and enemies around them. 

- {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} - The direct damage of {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} does additional damage and has a 5% chance to generate a Lunar Empowerment.

- {{< spell 279070 "High Noon" "beta" >}} - The direct damage of {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}} is increased and Sunfire gains a 3 yard radius increase. 


### Notable General/Non-Balance Specific Azerite Traits

- {{< spell 280559 "Laser Matrix" "beta" >}} - Laser Matrix causes your spells and abilities to shoot a blast of lasers, dealing split damage and healing friendly targets. Also enables Reorigination Array while within Uldir, increasing your highest secondary stat depending on how many bosses you have slain.


### Stacking Traits

Stacking traits tends to be the way to go as Balance Druid as we don’t lose much, if any damage from stacking multiple of the same effect. In fact, stacking the same Azerite traits can exponentially increase your damage per trait and even change the basic rotation of Moonkin.


### Rotation/Talent Changing Traits

- {{< spell 276153 "Dawning Sun" "beta" >}} - Slightly alters the rotation by incentivizing you to always have the 8 second buff up before casting {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}}s, even if the {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "beta" >}} is unempowered.

- {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" "beta" >}} - Besides the obvious gameplay change of not repeating the same ability twice in a row, it’s worth noting that abilities such as {{< spell 202770 "Fury of Elune" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 205636 "Force of Nature" "beta" >}} should be used before {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "beta" >}} or {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "beta" >}} if you have at least 2 traits as they don’t affect the proc.

Keep in mind that Streaking Stars isn’t affected by abilities such as {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "beta" >}} and has a reduced amount of damage in conjunction with Incarnation: Chosen of Elune (so Streaking Stars doesn’t make Incarnation a more viable pick).

- {{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" "beta" >}} - Lunar Shrapnel increases the value of Astral Power, leading to {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 202430 "Nature’s Balance" "beta" >}} becoming stronger talent choices.

- {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} - Opens up the possibility of spamming {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} on 2-4 targets. {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "beta" >}} also gains power in the tier 75 row, becoming the best of the three due to the other two relying on Astral Power generation to get great effect, something Moonfire spam lacks. Nature’s Balance gains some leeway as well since the other options lose strength in multi-target or just aren’t worth as much since Moonfire hits so hard and taking them would mean less Moonfires. For more info on the Moonfire spam rotation, see the Rotation section.

- {{< spell 279070 "High Noon" "beta" >}} - Much like Power of the Moon, High Noon can possibly change your rotation by spamming {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}} on 1-2 targets if you have access to 3 High Noon traits. Incarnation also becomes the go to talent of the tier 75 row as you generate much less Astral Power, reducing the competitors power. For more info on the Sunfire spam rotation, see the Rotation section.


### Top Traits

This is a list of our most potent traits, ones that you should seek out if you can as they dramatically improve a Balance Druids performance in the correct scenario.	

- {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" "beta" >}} - Being one of our top single target traits and offering ludicrous burst that puts most other classes to shame, it’s no surprise Streaking Stars is a top trait. This level of burst is invaluable in raids, especially if there is a period of damage amplification, a target needs to die fast, or the kill time lines up nicely with our cooldowns.

- {{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" "beta" >}} - A niche, yet powerful trait in the right situation. At 4+ targets Lunar Shrapnel becomes our best trait and only scales more and more with enemies. If an encounter calls for as much multi-target damage as you can push and there are many targets to hit, this should be in your mind when choosing your Azerite gear.

- {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} - In constant 2-3 target cleave encounters, Power of the Moon is unmatched, allowing for absolutely no downtime and consistent damage. When there is multi-target, but not enough to warrant full on mass AoE, Power of the Moon is a wise choice.

- {{< spell 279070 "High Noon" "beta" >}} - The ultimate single target trait when stacked 3 times, High Noon brings incredible single target damage with no loss of damage due to movement.  High Noon is at it’s best in high movement fights where the fight lacks high priority burst periods and or ends at bad kill times for your damage cooldowns. This trait also scales better and better at higher item levels, eventually becoming our highest simming trait in roughly heroic Uldir level gear.

- {{< spell 280559 "Laser Matrix" "beta" >}} - Laser Matrix is a decent trait on single target and mediocre on multi-target, but also activates Reorigination Array in Uldir. This buff will eventually be awarding us with up to over 800 of our highest secondary stat, easily surpassing other traits in damage at this point.
