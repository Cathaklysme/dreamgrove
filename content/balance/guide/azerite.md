Like other gear, Azerite gear should be simmed, just because a piece of gear has your best trait doesn’t mean it is an upgrade. Use logic when choosing between Azerite pieces as well, just because a trait sims less doesn’t mean it is worse if it gives more burst for example. When choosing between defensive vs. offensive Azerite, weigh how important survivability is and if it is needed. This can not be properly explained in a guide as these situations are much too specific.

### Balance Druid Traits 

- Dawning Sun - Lunar Strikes increases the damage of all Solar Wraths within the next 8 seconds. Overall, a mediocre trait that doesn’t affect your damage very much.

- Sunblaze - Causes Solar Wrath to increase the damage of Starsurge. Much like Dawning Sun, Sunblaze doesn’t do very much for your damage and even worse, not scaling with more targets. It could be useful if you need constant single target burst, but that is very niche and is rarely worth using if you have a choice.

- Streaking Stars - During Celestial Alignment, every non repeated spell inflicts bonus damage upon the target. Our premier single target Azerite trait, allowing for crazy burst during cooldowns. It is important to note this trait does not work with spells such as Starfall and does not gain more power from Incarnation: Chosen of Elune as the damage of Streaking Stars is reduced when talented into it. 

- Lunar Shrapnel - Enemies with Moonfire applied who are hit by Starfall pulse damage to themselves and enemies around them. The go-to trait for sustained multi-target, Lunar Shrapnel provides excellent damage on stacked mobs, but at the loss of single target damage.

- Power of the Moon - The direct damage of Moonfire does additional damage and has a 5% chance to generate a Lunar Empowerment. This is the dominant trait in 2 or 3 target fights, due to making Moonfire so powerful that you should spam it anytime there is an appropriate amount of targets. For more information on Moonfire spam, look in the Rotation section.

- High Noon - The direct and DoT effect of Sunfire is increased and Sunfire gains a 3 yard radius increase. Similar to Power of the Moon, High Noon has the possibility of making you spam Sunfire on a single target, resulting in no loss of damage through movement and doing more damage than Streaking Stars. For more information on Sunfire spam, look in the Rotation section.

### Notable General/Non-Balance Specific Azerite Traits

- Laser Matrix - Laser Matrix Causes your spells and abilities to shoot a blast of lasers, dealing split damage and healing friendly targets.  Being comparable to Streaking Stars in damage and also healing your raid. It is safe to say this trait is going to be highly desired as it also actives Reorigination Array, a passive buff in Uldir giving you a huge amount of your most plentiful secondary stat based on how many bosses in Uldir you have slain.  

- Lively Spirit - Awards you with an impressive amount of intellect based on how many spells the healer you Innervated casts, lasting 20 seconds. Albeit more complicated to pull off, Lively Spirit has a reward for using it correctly. That is being nearly equal to Streaking Stars on single target, and scaling well in multi-target situations, granting absurd burst damage.
