Currently Moonkin’s talents are generally extremely close in power overall, but it is still important that you choose the correct talents for the encounter if you wish to thrive as Balance. Understanding a talents’ strong suit is the key to playing optimally..

### Tier 15:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="15" src="beta" >}}

Nature’s Balance (NB): Generates 2 Astral Power every 3 seconds and also makes your base Astral Power out of combat 50 rather than 0. Decent for sustained multi-target giving us constantly generating Astral Power. This talent, albeit niche, has the potential to be advantageous in Mythic+, notably those with long spans of downtime, giving the talent time to recharge your Astral Power to 50. Meaning it is also great in open world content as you’re regularly walking from place to place.

Warrior of Elune (WoE): On activation, causes your next 3 Lunar Strikes to be instant cast and award 40% more astral power. This talent grants useful burst and priority target damage. Warrior of Elune is the best in the Tier 15 row for dealing with high movement encounters, generating 3 GCDs (Global Cooldowns) of movement and enough Astral Power for a spender. The three free Lunar Strikes should be used back to back regardless of if they’re empowered or not unless you’d overcap Astral Power.

Force of Nature (FoN): Summons 3 treants to taunt enemies in an area and deal damage. Being the best on pure single target Patchwerk fights, these treants should be used on cooldown. Their real strength comes in the form of Mythic+ utility, giving the tank breathing room against hard hitting mobs and is notably useful on Raging and Necrotic weeks. They are also strong for open world, allowing you to pull huge packs of enemies and effortlessly AoE them down.

### Tier 30:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="30" src="beta" >}}

Wild Charge (WC): The general choice in the row, we can use this ability to great effect in getting around the encounter. Having a very short cooldown, you can use Wild Charge to deal with most mechanics, meaning Wild Charge overshadows its competitors most of the time.

Tiger Dash (TD): Shapeshifts you into Cat Form, boosting your movement speed by 200% and gradually reducing overtime. Tiger Dash can be used for open world questing, otherwise TD is very niche for fights where you need to cover large distances very quickly in which Wild Charge wouldn’t do the trick. 

Renewal: 90 second cooldown in which you heal for 30% of your maximum health. A decent choice if the other two options offer very little in comparison, such as a Patchwerk fight.

### Tier 45:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="45" src="beta" >}}

Feral Affinity: Besides nearly useless Feral abilities, Feral Affinity gives you 15% movement speed, which is only useful if the other two options are completely worthless.

Guardian Affinity: As said before, Guardian Affinity talent is the go-to for most situations, granting generous survivability through the 6% damage reduction and decent healing through Frenzied Regeneration.

Restoration Affinity: Heals you for 3% of your maximum health every 5 seconds and allows you to access healing abilities such as Rejuvenation, Swiftmend, and Wild Growth. This can be a wise talent to take in open world to keep your health topped off.

### Tier 60:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="60" src="beta" >}}

Mighty Bash: A single target 5 second stun. Generally not very substantial, but when it is, it’s a strong talent.

Mass Entanglement: Roots a target and surrounding enemies around the target for 30 seconds. It can be incredibly powerful if it is used to cheese certain fights. Otherwise other talents will generally see much more use.

Typhoon: Knocks enemies in front of you away and slows them. Being the default choice of the row, Typhoon has the most uses. Its kiting ability has proven to be invaluable in open world and certain encounters.

### Tier 75:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="75" src="beta" >}}

Soul of the Forest (SotF): Reduces the cost of Starfall by 10 Astral Power and grants Empowerments a 30% multiplicative scaling. The best in the row when it comes to sustained multi-target, making your Empowerments hit harder and saving you Astral Power to throw more starfalls out.

Starlord (SL): Causes your spenders to award a stack of 3% haste, stacking up to 3 times and not refreshing the duration with a new stack. Offering the best low target damage and great multi-target, this talent can be utilized to its fullest by not spending any Astral Power in the last 5 seconds of the buff. Starlord isn’t heavily impacted by kill time like incarnation is, but suffers more in heavy movement.

Incarnation: Chosen of Elune (Incarn): This talent replaces Celestial Alignment as our 3 minute cooldown enhancing our damage cooldown with longer duration and more % damage gain. Incarn can be very potent in situations where large burst is required. Otherwise it falls behind the other options in raw output and is massively impacted by kill time. If you are mostly spamming Sunfire or Moonfire (due to Azerite traits), Incarn gains a lot of value, becoming the best talent in the row (explained later in the guide).

### Tier 90: 
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="90" src="beta" >}}

Stellar Drift (SD): Allows you to freely move within Starfall’s radius and increases Starfalls damage, Stellar Drift is sadly outclassed by Twin Moons outside of niche situations

Twin Moons (TM): Causes your Moonfire to spread to one extra target. Twin Moons is generally the best on most raid bosses and in dungeons as it is nearly the highest damage on single target and is amazing for multi-target due to raw throughput and reducing our ramp time significantly.

Stellar Flare (StFl): A third DoT and the top single target option by a small margin, this spell falls off with any new targets being introduced. But, it can be decent if there are a low amount of spread targets.

### Tier 100:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="100" src="beta" >}}

Shooting Stars (ShS): Moonfire and Sunfire have a chance to generate a shooting star which damages the enemy and grants you 4 Astral Power. This ability is the best pure single target and two target option. There is a hidden diminishing return attached to Shooting Stars which is why it loses value with more targets unless they are spread.

Fury of Elune (FoE): Our ultimate burst ability, awarding unmatched burst in a short 1 minute cooldown in the form of a tremendous laser which cleaves every target in an 8 yard radius. Any time there is 3+ targets Fury of Elune will tend to be the best option unless the targets aren’t stacked. In addition to doing a lot of damage, FoE grants you 40 Astral Power which can keep the burst going, generally making spell the go-to for heavy burst as well.

New Moon (Moons): An ability which cycles through 3 types of moons that increase in power, cast time, and Astral Power Generation. The weakest option in the row, Moons lack any real niche and just aren’t worth taking in any situation.
