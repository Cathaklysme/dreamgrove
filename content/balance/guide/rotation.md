*Balance doesn’t follow a strict rotation, it’s more of a priority list.*

### Opener

2.5 seconds before the pull cast two {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wraths" "live" >}} standing away from the boss. As soon as the timer hits 0 and the boss is pulled apply {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "live" >}}, {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "live" >}}, and if talented, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" "live" >}}. At this point spam Solar wrath until you reach at least 40 Astral Power and activate {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "live" >}}/{{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "live" >}}.

1. 2x Solar Wrath
2. Sunfire and Moonfire
3. Stellar Flare
4. Solar Wrath to 40 AsP
5. Celestial Alignment / Incarnation
6. Fury of Elune / Force of Nature/ Warrior of Elune

### Single Target

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "live" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "live" >}}, and Stellar Flare if talented. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range (30% of the original DoT, this is 6.6 seconds for Moonfire, 5.4 seconds for Sunfire, and 7.2 seconds for Stellar Flare.)

2. Avoid capping Astral Power and generate Empowerments by casting {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}}.

3. Spend Solar and Lunar {{< spell 279708 "Empowerments" "live" >}}. It is important you don’t cap Empowerments unless you would otherwise cap Astral Power. If you must waste one of the two, the Lunar Empowerment is worth more and you should waste a Solar Empowerment.

4. When you have no DoTs to apply and no Empowerments to spend, you should fill with {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "live" >}}.

### Multi-Target

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "live" >}} and {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "live" >}}. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Use Astral Power on {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "live" >}} if you can hit at least 4 targets with it (3 targets with {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" "live" >}} and 5 targets with {{< spell 287773 "Arcanic Pulsar" "ptr" >}}), otherwise spend your Astral Power on {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "live" >}}.

3. Spend any Solar or Lunar Empowerments you gain from casting fillers.

4. When you have no DoTs to apply and no Empowerments to spend, you should fill with {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "live" >}}. If you’re able to hit at least 2 targets, you should instead fill with {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "live" >}}.

### Streaking Stars Rotation During Cooldowns

Streaking Stars changes your playstyle during {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "live" >}}/{{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "live" >}}. Basically you should never repeat the same ability twice in a row, and should {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "live" >}} after every ability that isn't Solar Wrath, regardless of if it is empowered. It should be noted that you should cast all of your talented cooldowns directly after Celestial Alignment/Incarnation: Chosen of Elune, such as {{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" "live" >}}, {{< spell 202770 "Fury of Elune" "live" >}}, and {{< spell 205636 "Force of Nature" "live" >}}.

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "live" >}} and {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "live" >}}. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Don't cap on Astral Power by casting {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "live" >}} or {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "live" >}}.

3. Don't cap {{< spell 279708 "Empowerments" "live" >}}.

4. Cast {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" live" >}} if the last spell casted wasn't Solar Wrath.

5. Spend any Empowerments.

6. If you lack Empowerments, Astral Power for spenders, and DoTs to refresh the pandemic on, you should simply fill with Solar Wrath > Sunfire > Solar Wrath.

### Starlord Opener With Arcanic Pulsar

Put simply, the entire purpose of this opener is to get 3 casts of {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "live" >}} off before popping {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "live" >}} at 40 Astral Power, then at that point you should generate Astral Power until achieving 80 Astral power, cancelaura your Starlord, and start the normal rotation. It should look like this:

1. Starsurge
2. Apply Sunfire, Moonfire, and Stellar Flare (if talented)
3. Generate 40 Astral Power with Empowerments and Solar Wrath
4. Starsurge
5. Generate 40 Astral Power with Empowerments and Solar Wrath
6. Starsurge
7. Generate 40 Astral power and cast Celestial Alignment
8. Build up to 80 Astral Power
9. Cancelaura Starlord
10. Normal Rotation

If you are not using {{< spell 202430 "Nature’s Balance" "live" >}}, it's worth noting you should open slightly different, instead with x2 Solar Wraths 3 seconds before the pull, with Force of Nature or Warrior of Elune directly after (Fury of Elune too if talented), with the goal still being to {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "live" >}} 3 times before casting Celestial Alignment.

### Starlord Rotation

The rotation when using {{< spell 202345 "Starlord" "live" >}} is the same as the normal rotation with one important rule to maximize the talents power. Basically, you will "cancelaura" the Starlord buff whenever you have less than 7 seconds remaining on the buff and you are about to cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "live" >}}. Cancelaura meaning to remove the Starlord buff from yourself. The optimal way of doing this is to start pooling Astral Power once you have less than 7 seconds remaining on Starlord until you have 88 Astral Power (this can be done with less Astral Power if needed to Starsurge for movement), at this point you should use your cancelaura macro and then Starsurge. The macro to cancelaura Starlord can be found below.
