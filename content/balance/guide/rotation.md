*Balance doesn’t follow a strict rotation, it’s more of a priority list.*

### Opener

2.5 seconds before the pull cast two {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wraths" "beta" >}} standing away from the boss. As soon as the timer hits 0 and the boss is pulled apply {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}}, and if talented, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" "beta" >}}. At this point spam Solar wrath until you reach at least 40 Astral Power and activate {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "beta" >}}/{{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "beta" >}}.

1. 2x Solar Wrath
2. Sunfire and Moonfire
3. Stellar Flare
4. Solar Wrath to 40 AsP
5. Celestial Alignment / Incarnation
6. Fury of Elune / Force of Nature/ Warrior of Elune

### Single Target and Two Targets

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}, and Stellar Flare if talented. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range (30% of the original DoT, this is 6.6 seconds for Moonfire, 5.4 seconds for Sunfire, and 7.2 seconds for Stellar Flare.)

2. Avoid capping Astral Power by casting {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}}

3. Spend Solar and Lunar {{< spell 279708 "Empowerments" "beta" >}}. It is important you don’t cap Empowerments unless you would otherwise cap Astral Power. If you must waste one of the two, the Lunar Empowerment is worth more and you should waste a Solar Empowerment.

4. When you have no DoTs to apply and no Empowerments to spend, you should fill with {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}}. If you’re able to hit even one extra target, you should instead fill with {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "beta" >}}.

### Multi-Target

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Use Astral Power on {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "beta" >}} if you can hit at least 3 targets with it, otherwise spend your Astral Power on {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}}.

3. Spend any Solar or Lunar Empowerments you gain from casting fillers.

4. When you have no DoTs to apply and no Empowerments to spend, you should fill with {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}}. If you’re able to hit at least 3 targets, you should instead fill with {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "beta" >}}.

Rotation With 2-3 {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} Traits

If you have 2 Power of the Moon traits it is important to understand the rotation changes on 2 targets, instead filling with Moonfire and not casting {{< spell 279708 "Empowerments" "beta" >}}. With 3 traits, Moonfire spam becomes best on 2-3 targets.

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Avoid overcapping Astral Power by casting {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}} on 2 targets and {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "beta" >}} on 3 targets.

3. Fill with {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}}.

### Rotation With 3 High Noon Traits

Much like {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}}, having 3 {{< spell 279070 "High Noon" "beta" >}} traits makes it worth mostly spamming a single ability, Sunfire being that ability, and only if you are attacking a single target. In this situation you should follow a similar priority:

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Avoid overcapping Astral Power by casting {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}}.

3. Fill with {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}.
