## Rotation / Priority List	

*Balance doesn’t follow a strict rotation, it’s more of a priority list.*

### Opener

2.5 seconds before the pull cast two Solar Wraths standing away from the boss. As soon as the timer hits 0 and the boss is pulled apply Sunfire, Moonfire, and if talented, Stellar Flare. At this point spam Solar wrath until you reach at least 40 Astral Power and activate Celestial Alignment/Incarnation: Chosen of Elune.

- Wrath > Wrath > DoT > DoT > (Stellar Flare*) > Wrath until 40 > Cooldowns > (FoE* and FoN*) > Rotation

### Single Target and Two Targets

1. Maintain 100% uptime on Moonfire, Sunfire, and Stellar Flare if talented. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range (30% of the original DoT, this is 6.6 seconds for Moonfire, 5.4 seconds for Sunfire, and 7.2 seconds for Stellar Flare.)

2. Avoid capping Astral Power by casting Starsurge

3. Spend Solar and Lunar Empowerments. It is important you don’t cap Empowerments unless you would otherwise cap Astral Power. If you must waste one of the two, the Lunar Empowerment is worth more and you should waste a Solar Empowerment.

4. When you have no DoTs to apply and no Empowerments to spend, you should fill with Solar Wrath. If you’re able to hit even one extra target, you should instead fill with Lunar Strike.

### Multi-Target

1. Maintain 100% uptime on Moonfire and Sunfire. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Use Astral Power on Starfall if you can hit at least 3 targets with it, otherwise spend your Astral Power on Starsurge.

3. Spend any Solar or Lunar Empowerments you gain from casting fillers.

4. When you have no DoTs to apply and no Empowerments to spend, you should fill with Solar Wrath. If you’re able to hit at least 3 targets, you should instead fill with Lunar Strike.

Rotation With 2-3 Power of the Moon Traits

If you have 2 Power of the Moon traits it is important to understand the rotation changes on 2 targets, instead filling with Moonfire and not casting Empowerments. With 3 traits, Moonfire spam becomes best on 2-3 targets.

1. Maintain 100% uptime on Moonfire and Sunfire. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Avoid overcapping Astral Power by casting Starsurge on 2 targets and Starfall on 3 targets.

3. Fill with Moonfire.

### Rotation With 3 High Noon Traits

Much like Power of the Moon, having 3 High Noon traits makes it worth mostly spamming a single ability, Sunfire being that ability, and only if you are attacking a single target. In this situation you should follow a similar priority:

1. Maintain 100% uptime on Moonfire and Sunfire. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Avoid overcapping Astral Power by casting Starsurge.

3. Fill with Sunfire
