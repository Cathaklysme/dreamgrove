*Balance doesn’t follow a strict rotation, it’s more of a priority list.*

### Opener

2.5 seconds before the pull cast two {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wraths" "beta" >}} standing away from the boss. As soon as the timer hits 0 and the boss is pulled apply {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}}, and if talented, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" "beta" >}}. At this point spam Solar wrath until you reach at least 40 Astral Power and activate {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "beta" >}}/{{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "beta" >}}.

1. 2x Solar Wrath
2. Sunfire and Moonfire
3. Stellar Flare
4. Solar Wrath to 40 AsP
5. Celestial Alignment / Incarnation
6. Fury of Elune / Force of Nature/ Warrior of Elune

### Single Target and Two Targets

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}, and Stellar Flare if talented. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range (30% of the original DoT, this is 6.6 seconds for Moonfire, 5.4 seconds for Sunfire, and 7.2 seconds for Stellar Flare.)

2. Avoid capping Astral Power and generate Empowerments by casting {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}}.

3. Spend Solar and Lunar {{< spell 279708 "Empowerments" "beta" >}}. It is important you don’t cap Empowerments unless you would otherwise cap Astral Power. If you must waste one of the two, the Lunar Empowerment is worth more and you should waste a Solar Empowerment.

4. When you have no DoTs to apply and no Empowerments to spend, you should fill with {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}}, or {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "beta" >}} if you can hit at least 2 targets.

### Multi-Target

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Use Astral Power on {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "beta" >}} if you can hit at least 3 targets with it, otherwise spend your Astral Power on {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}}.

3. Spend any Solar or Lunar Empowerments you gain from casting fillers.

4. When you have no DoTs to apply and no Empowerments to spend, you should fill with {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}}. If you’re able to hit at least 2 targets, you should instead fill with {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "beta" >}}.

Rotation With 2-3 {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" "beta" >}} Traits

If you have at least 2 Power of the Moon traits it is important to understand the rotation changes on 2 targets, instead filling with Moonfire. With 3 traits equipped, Moonfire spam should be used on 2-4 targets, ignoring Empowerments entirely on 2 targets and only casting Lunar Empowerments on 3+ targets. If there is only 1 target, or there is 5 or more targets, then you should follow the normal rotation.

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Avoid overcapping Astral Power by casting {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}} on 2 targets and {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "beta" >}} on 3+ targets.

3. Spend {{< spell 279708 "Empowerments" "beta" >}} on 2+ targets (skip this step with 3 Power of the Moon traits).

4. Spend Lunar Empowerments on 3+ targets.

5. Fill with {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}}.

### Streaking Stars Rotation During Cooldowns

Streaking Stars changes your playstyle during {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "beta" >}}/{{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "beta" >}}. Basically you should never repeat the same ability twice in a row, and should {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}} after every ability that isn't Solar Wrath, regardless of if it is empowered. It should be noted that you should cast all of your talented cooldowns directly after Celestial Alignment/Incarnation: Chosen of Elune, such as {{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 202770 "Fury of Elune" "beta" >}}, and {{< spell 205636 "Force of Nature" "beta" >}}.

1. Maintain 100% uptime on {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Don't cap on Astral Power by casting {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "beta" >}} or {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "beta" >}}.

3. Don't cap {{< spell 279708 "Empowerments" "beta" >}}.

4. Cast {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "beta" >}} if the last spell casted wasn't Solar Wrath.

5. Spend any Empowerments.

6. If you lack Empowerments, Astral Power for spenders, and DoTs to refresh the pandemic on, you should simply fill with Solar Wrath > Sunfire > Solar Wrath.
