Balance Druid brings many strengths, but also suffers from weaknesses like any specialization. It is important that you understand these if you wish to get the most out of Moonkin. 

### Strengths:

Defensives - {{< spell 22812 “Barkskin" "beta" >}} is a decent defensive with a short cooldown that lines up with many abilities. When paired with {{< spell 5487 “Bear Form" "beta" >}}, another strong defensive, becomes a powerful cooldown that can help you survive incredible amounts of damage. Additionally, you have the go-to raiding talent, {{< spell 197491 “Guardian Affinity" "beta" >}}, which offers another a passive 6% damage reduction and a modest 24% heal through frenzied regeneration.

Utility - Moonkin offers strong utility through the three choices of {{< spell 132469 “Typhoon" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 102359 “Mass Entanglement" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 5211 “Mighty Bash" "beta" >}}. These talents granting us impressive crowd control, allow us to displace enemies into more favorable positions for the raid group, root entire groups of mobs to trivialize a mechanic, or stun a priority target respectively. Talenting {{< spell 205636 “Force of Nature" "beta" >}} also provides an underrated defensive cooldown which gives the tank time to reestablish their defensives. Baseline, we bring {{< spell 29166 “Innervate" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 339 “Entangling Roots" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 2908 “Soothe" "beta" >}}, and {{< spell 2637 “Hibernate" "beta" >}}. Innervate is a progression cooldown in which your healer can cast any healing spell for free for 12 seconds. This is useful for long and or high damage fights. Entangling Roots, Soothe, and Hibernate all have the potential to make certain mechanics of a fight insignificant. Another notable part of our utility is {{< spell 78675 “Solar Beam" "beta" >}}. Whenever Solar beam is able to completely silence an enemy, it tends to be highly valuable.

Priority Damage - If planned accordingly, Balance has capable priority damage, being able to pool resources to quickly burst down a target with {{< spell 78674 “Starsurges" "beta" >}} and through those, {{< spell 279708 “Empowerments" "beta" >}}. Talenting {{< spell 202425 “Warrior of Elune" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 202770 “Fury of Elune" "beta" >}} further strengthens our already potent priority damage, making us high tier in this regard.

Sustained Multi-Target - Outside of cooldowns, Moonkin brings good sustained damage on multiple targets. We bring sustained multi-target through our DoTs and {{< spell 191034 “Starfall" "beta" >}}, giving us consistent damage once {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 123413 "Moonfire" "beta" >}} are up and running and we can start generating Astral Power to lay blankets of Starfalls. This is the strength we’re known for and we are nearly unmatched in that aspect.

### Weaknesses:

Weak Cooldowns - {{< spell 194223 “Celestial Alignment" "beta" >}} is one of the weakest cooldowns in the entire game in comparison to other classes. Offering very little for a 3 minute cooldown, you would see very little difference in your overall damage if you didn’t use it at all.

Limited Cleave Range - A majority of our abilities can only strike multiple targets within an 8 yard radius, those abilities being {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "beta" >}}, Empowered {{< spell 190984 “Solar Wrath" "beta" >}}, {{< spell 194153 “Lunar Strike" "beta" >}}, and {{< spell 202770 “Fury of Elune" "beta" >}}. Similarly {{< spell 191034 “Starfall" "beta" >}} can only strike targets within a 30 yard radius, potentially losing a portion of our damage if targets in a fight are too spread out.

Long Ramp Time - Moonkin requires a long amount of time to get its damage going compared to other classes. In multi-target situations you must DoT every target and in single target situations, you must build up enough Astral Power to start firing out {{< spell 78674 “Starsurges" "beta" >}} and {{< spell 279708 “Empowerments" "beta" >}}.

Mobility While Casting - Being a caster, it is imperative you are prepared for movement and deal with mechanics while also dealing damage, but Balance has huge problems achieving that. With our slow Astral Power generation it can be difficult to have enough resources to be able to Starsurge out of a mechanic.
