Balance Druid brings many strengths, but also suffers from weaknesses like any specialization. It is important that you understand these if you wish to get the most out of Moonkin. 

### Strengths:

Defensives - Barkskin is a decent defensive with a short cooldown that lines up with many abilities. When paired with Bear Form, another strong defensive, becomes a powerful cooldown that can help you survive incredible amounts of damage. Additionally, you have the go-to raiding talent, Guardian Affinity, which offers another a passive 6% damage reduction and a modest 24% heal through frenzied regeneration.

Utility - Moonkin offers strong utility through the three choices of Typhoon, Mass Entanglement and Mighty Bash. These talents granting us impressive crowd control, allow us to displace enemies into more favorable positions for the raid group, root entire groups of mobs to trivialize a mechanic, or stun a priority target respectively. Talenting Force of Nature also provides an underrated tank cooldown which gives the tank time to reestablish their defensives. Baseline, we bring Innervate, Entangling Roots, Soothe, and Hibernate. Innervate is a progression cooldown in which your healer can cast any healing spell for free for 12 seconds. This is useful for long and or high damage fights. Entangling Roots, Soothe, and Hibernate all have the potential to make certain mechanics of a fight insignificant. Another notable part of our utility is Solarbeam. Whenever Solarbeam is able to completely silence an enemy, it tends to be highly valuable.

Priority Damage - If planned accordingly, Balance has capable priority damage, being able to pool resources to quickly burst down a target with Starsurges and through those, Empowerments. Talenting Warrior of Elune and Fury of Elune further strengthens our already potent priority damage, making us high tier in this regard.

Sustained Multi-Target - Outside of cooldowns, Moonkin brings good sustained damage on multiple targets. We bring sustained multi-target through our DoTs and Starfall, giving us consistent damage once Sunfire and Moonfire are up and running and we can start generating Astral Power to lay blankets of Starfalls. This is the strength we’re known for and we are nearly unmatched in that aspect.

### Weaknesses:

Weak Cooldowns - Celestial Alignment is one of the weakest cooldowns in the entire game in comparison to other classes. Offering very little for a 3 minute cooldown, you would see very little difference in your overall damage if you didn’t use it at all.

Limited Cleave Range - A majority of our abilities can only strike multiple targets within an 8 yard radius, those abilities being Sunfire, Empowered Solar Wrath, Lunar Strike, and Fury of Elune. Similarly Starfall can only strike targets within a 30 yard radius, potentially losing a portion of our damage if targets in a fight are too spread out.

Long Ramp Time - Moonkin requires a long amount of time to get its damage going compared to other classes. In multi-target situations you must DoT every target and in single target situations, you must build up enough Astral Power to start firing out Starsurges and Empowerments.

Mobility While Casting - Being a caster, it is imperative you are prepared for movement and deal with mechanics while also dealing damage, but Balance has huge problems achieving that. With our slow Astral Power generation it can be difficult to have enough resources to be able to Starsurge out of a mechanic.
