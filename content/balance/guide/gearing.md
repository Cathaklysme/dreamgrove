It is heavily recommended you sim your character regardless of what guides say as that is almost always the best way to know if something is an upgrade.

Intellect is your primary stat, it will be on almost all of your gear besides jewelry and some trinkets, usually you don’t want to sacrifice too much item level for secondaries stats as it is not worth losing too much intellect. Otherwise your secondary stat priority will usually look something like so: 

- **Haste > Crit >= Vers > Mastery**

### Enchants:

- {{< item 159786 "Enchant Weapon - Quick Navigation" "beta" >}}
- {{< item 153443 "Enchant Ring - Pact of Haste" "beta" >}}

### Consumables: 

- {{< item 152639 "Flask of Endless Fathoms" "beta" >}}
- {{< item 163222 "Battle Potion of Intellect" "beta" >}} for 3+ targets or {{< item 152559 "Potion of Rising Death" "beta" >}} for 1-2 targets
- {{< item 156526 "Bountiful Captain’s Feast" "beta" >}} or {{< item 154884 "Swamp Fish ‘n Chips" "beta" >}}

### Sockets: 

- One {{< item 153709 "Kraken’s Eye of Intellect" "beta" >}} 
- {{< item 154127 "Quick Owlseye" "beta" >}} in your remaining slots.

### Notable trinkets you should consider are the following: 

- {{< item 159624 "Rotcrusted Voodoo Doll" "beta" >}} and {{< item 159631 "Lady Waycrest’s Music Box" "beta" >}} for single target.
- {{< item 159615 "Ignition Mage’s Fuse" "beta" >}} and {{< item 159620 "Conch of Dark Whispers" "beta" >}} for multi-target.
- {{< item 161377 "Azurethos’ Singed Plumage" "beta" >}} and {{< item 161380 "Drust-Runed Icicle" "beta" >}} are strong overall.
