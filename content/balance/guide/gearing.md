It is heavily recommended you sim your character regardless of what guides say as that is almost always the best way to know if something is an upgrade.

Intellect is your primary stat, it will be on almost all of your gear besides jewelry and some trinkets, usually you don’t want to sacrifice too much item level for secondaries stats as it is not worth losing too much intellect. Otherwise your secondary stat priority will usually look something like so: 

- Haste > Crit >= Vers > Mastery

Notable trinkets you should consider are the following: 

- Rotcrusted Voodoo Doll and Lady Waycrest’s Music Box for single target
- Ignition Mage’s Fuse and Conch of Dark Whispers for multi-target.
- Azurethos’ Singed Plumage and Drust-Runed Icicle are strong overall.

Once trinket simulations are more concrete, a trinket spreadsheet will be added here to give a more full rough estimate of useful trinkets you should look out for. Until then it is recommended you sim all trinkets you think may be upgrades and hold onto those. These listed trinkets are not always going to be upgrades for your own character.
