Hey guys, we decided to help everybody out who is raiding on the pre-patch with a pre-patch specific talent and legendary guide! The talent/legendary recommendations presented in this guide were made with progression in mind, not number "padding" or farm kills where most of the highest parses come from.  Keep in mind that these recommendations are made to maximize the effectiveness of our class, but does not consider YOUR raid group composition.  If your raid is full of burst AoE classes that absolutely destroy adds, then you may want to switch to a more single target build to provide more boss damage.  This guide provides a general starting point, but adjusting talents/legendaries to better fit what the raid needs will benefit the raid's progression the most over stubbornly sticking to the one recommended build.


## Garothi Worldbreaker

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="231,312,213,321,231,321,132" >}}

The only really contested talents are Warrior of Elune vs Force of Nature and Twin Moons vs Stellar Flare. For a fight like Garothi we think Warrior of Elune will give you slightly more mobility in order to be able to dodge the beams and soak the circles on the ground. As for Stellar Flare vs Twin Moons, even though you can cleave the 2 cannons for a bit, it is not better than the .6% that Stellar Flare provides.

### Legendaries:

Lady and the Child and Sephuz Secret are the best unless you are somehow cheesing multiple targets with Kil’Jaeden’s Burning Wish.


## Fel-Hounds

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="231,321,213,321,231,213,123" >}}

As for the talents here, none of them are really questionable. With the recent buffs to Shooting Stars, this talent has increased in DPS by a fair amount. Remember that you are still Starsurging on 2 targets regardless of whether the dogs are stacked or not.

### Legendaries:

Lady and the Child and Sephuz’s Secret are the default choices. If you are able to stack the dogs for the full duration of the encounter, then play Oneth’s Intuition.
