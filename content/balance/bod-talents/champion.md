<b>Notes</b>

This is a mostly stationary fight made up of 2 distinct phases, an add DPS phase and a Single target boss phase with priority add damage mixed in. We recommend taking talents that can push both boss damage and add damage. Starlord can be a strong choice if youâ€™re comfortable with the movement of this encounter as it allows for better priority damage.
