**How does this impact our talent choices?**

Level 75 Changes
Soul of the Forest was overvalued in the previous builds of Beta Moonkin, and we were unaware until recently. 
This means, you will now want to take Incarnation: Chosen of Elune on patchwork, 3 target, and 5 target situations. 
This will be the go to M+ talent for the Level 75 row. 

Level 90 Changes
With the heavy nerfs to Stellar Flare, you will now take Twin Moons in all hybrid and 2+ target situations. 
The only time that it is profitable to take Stellar Flare will be patchwork single target encounters, because it is ~.8% damage increase over Twin Moons on patchwork.

Level 100 Changes
New Moon even at a 25 second recharge, is still worse than Fury of Elune without the mastery coefficient. 
You will continue to take Fury of Elune in M+ and up to 7 stacked targets sustained on multi-target. 
Alternatively, if the targets are not stacked, you will take Shooting Stars starting at 4 targets sustained as opposed to starting at 7 targets.
