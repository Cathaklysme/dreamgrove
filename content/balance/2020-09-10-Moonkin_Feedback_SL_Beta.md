## Comments on the 08-Oct-20 changes

* Shooting Stars Astral Power generation buffed from 2 to 3 and proc rate buffed from 10% to 15%. DR for multiple targets still exists
  * Much needed buff that was promised is now here making it finally generate relevant Astral Power.
  * Makes Solstice easily the best T50 talent in all situations outside very specific burst scenarios.
* Soul of the Forest buffed with Solar Eclipse making Wrath generate 50% more Astral Power instead of 25% and Starfire splash increased from 100% bonus to 150% bonus
  * A bit weird of a buff because it was already the best talent for anything above 1 target in that row and stays this way but ultimately nothing negative
* Starlord duration decreased from 20 seconds to 15 seconds and haste amount buffed from 3% to 4% per stack
  * Finally no longer need to cancel Starlord since the duration matches Eclipses, only a bit weird with Celestial Alignment now but this is a good change either way
  * Still doesn't work well with Starfall
  * As before this was and stays the best single target talent
* Necrolord Covenant ability Adaptive Swarm buffed by 22% for Balance Druids
  * Makes it not beyond trash tier for single target and even competitive without the legendary Balance of All Things but still suffers from not scaling with targets
* All damage buffed by 12.2%
  * This mainly exists so that people will not be doing tank damage in beta and pre patch and will probably allow us to be somewhere at the bottom of middle tier and for specific fights even higher. Obviously this does not fix any issues with the spec itself.
 
Overall the first positive patch of Beta/PTR for us. In total this is about a 15% damage buff and a 10-20% buff to our Astral Power generation depending on the situation which helps gameplay. The extra Astral Power in AoE is unfourtunately mostly wasted due to us already achieving 100% Starfall uptime and extra Starsurges not mattering too much. The only questionable result of this is that starting from 6 targets you will rather cap Astral Power than use leftover on Starsurges during Lunar Eclipse as Starfires will simply deal more damage even when including the additional Starfire crit.


## General


### Scaling

Wrath Haste caps at 70% Haste which is reached with just base 18.9% Haste during Bloodlust+Celestial Alignment/Incarnation or 9.1% with Starlord added on top, making high haste feel very bad. Previously we could make slight use of this Haste by switching to Starfire on single target but now due to Starsurge Empowerment you are often stuck casting Wraths far below the gcd cap.

Our damage is very focused in our Celestial Alignment/Incarnation windows due to mastery double dipping and since it is our best stat we will have a lot of it. The more secondaries and thus mastery we have the more our damage will be focused into the cooldown window making all other timeframes feel worse and worse. Even the recent changes will inevtiably push us more towards our CD window as long as mastery double dipping exists.

The plentiful amount of crit buffs makes crit undesirable or even useless especially when combined with the legendary Balance of All Things (more about that later). Any crit increase means that this part of our damage now has zero scaling with crit making us scale worse than any spec that doesn't have crit increases in addition to the haste problems.

Since mastery has now been heavily nerfed for the second time we now have no stats left that scale well so even if we are tuned well at the start of a tier we will fall off the more gear people get. Due to that we will require new buffs every tier to keep up with others similar to how other specs like Windwalker have fallen off in the past.

### AoE and Starfall

A lot of our AoE damage comes from Starfall of which you can’t have more than one up at any time. This means that once enough Astral Power is generated during AoE any further Astral Power has to be used on Starsurge which is not a relevant dps increase or even a dps loss with enough targets (this includes the Empowerment bonus).
For high Haste or higher Astral Power generation to feel good we need to be able to effectively spend our Astral Power in some form. A solution could be a stackable Starfall, a (duration) hasted Starfall, an option to condense the Starfall damage, a way to empower Starfall with more Astral Power or something of similar effect.

Putting more power into Starsurge would start us down a road similar to BfA where we only used Starfall on 7 or more targets with the standard gear setup. Additionally casting a big single target nuke in AoE will always feel bad.

### Starsurge Empowerment

This recent change made Starsurge buff all following fillers in that Eclipse hidden in the tooltip of each Eclipse. Wrath is buffed by an additive 6% during Solar Eclipse per starsurge cast, and the crit chance of Starfire is buffed by an additive 6% with each cast during Lunar Eclipse.

While more damage is better than no compensation for the removal of the Eclipse extension (which was arguably a good decision), this brings with it a number of problems.
Later Starsurges become worth less than earlier Starsurges in each Eclipse. What this results in is that pooling Astral Power is now always a dps loss which is our only way of reliable handling movement during st encounters, effectively nerfing our already lacking movement.

As mentioned earlier, making Starsurge increase AoE damage is a dangerous path as seen in BfA. As a whole the Starsurge Empowerment feels like an afterthought and only has a negative impact on gameplay.

### Tuning

Currently Balance Druid is tuned low to okish.
~~Dots deal a low amount of damage to the point of Moonfire sometimes barely being worth casting on multiple targets. This is due to giving up significant amount of Astral Power generation and thus when having to dot more often not being able to keep up Starfall.~~
This is partly fixed due to Shooting Stars having been buffed a significant amount. Moonfire is still not worth casting during Lunar Eclipse in AoE with Soul of the Forest.

~~Shooting Stars baseline had an extremely minor impact as it’s tuned very low. The extra Astral Power is of little use in AoE scenarios and on single target it generates as little as 4% of our total Astral Power, only going up a small amount with more targets. The increase in power mentioned in a blue post is not implemented as of now.~~
Shooting Stars is now a relevant increase in Astral Power generation.

~~As a whole our Astral Power generation is very low which leads to rather stale gameplay of pressing your filler about 5 times on single target and 6-7 times in AoE between each spender with dots slowing things down even more due to Shooting Stars generating so little Astral Power. On single target a higher Astral Power generation would help gameplay flow a significant amount but on AoE this would require changes to Starfall to have an impact as described in the AoE and Starfall section.~~
With the Shooting Stars/Solstice and Soul of the Forest buffs we are now in a much better shape in terms of Astral Power generation but the problem with Astral Power in AoE with Starfall still exists. How the increased generation feels in single target is to be seen.

The various nerfs to our spenders have negatively impacted our potential single target burst. Both fillers can make up an equal or close to equal percentage of our damage now depending on the situation which seemingly goes against the filler/spender idea. This is mostly caused by Starsurge Empowerments.

## DPS Talents 

### Tier 15:

Nature’s Balance is the strongest single target choice and solves the problem of having to generate up to 50 Astral Power to start using a filler. Starting from 0 Astral Power means that during AoE it takes about 12 seconds before you can use your first Starfall otherwise.

Trees have their niche in tanking in M+ but deal basically no damage.

Warrior of Elune is now a competitive pick due to the Starfire buff on single target but requires SotF to be good on AoE. Low cd, off gcd abilities can feel bad to use as we are a spec that is hardcasting most of the time.

### Tier 40:

Soul of the Forest is now by far the best AoE talent as Starfire no longer deals AoE damage without it. On single target it is very bad as half of its value has no effect there.

Starlord is now the best pick for anything single target and still doesn't work Starfall as you are unable to stack it up when you can only use your spender every 8-10 seconds.

Incarnation has taken multiple hard hits with nerfs to our cooldowns and mastery. It is now a bad pick in all situations.

### Tier 45:

Stellar Flare is similar to Starlord in that it is only good on single target and starts being and feeling very bad with any further added targets.

Twin Moons and Stellar Drift both fit the exact same “niche” meaning one will always be picked over the other. Currently Starfall is strong enough and or dots are weak enough for Stellar Drift to always be the superior pick when deciding between the two. A talent move seems like the only good solution in this case as both significantly improve how AoE feels.

### Tier 50:

Fury of Elune has its only niche in burst damage but outside tuning feels good to press.

Solstice is a fun addition that fits as a passive talent and with the Shooting Stars buff outperforms both other talents.

Moons do not scale as well with AoE since only Full Moon splashes meaning it will always fall off on multiple targets which is fine but even on single target it’s outclassed. Outside tuning Moons freshen up the rotation which is always positive.

## Covenants

Generally Night Fae is the only Covenant ability that feels good to use (outside of major problems mentioned later). The others are either passive or just used on cd and have barely any impact if any at all on the rotation as they do not interact with the spec itself to a relevant degree.
 
### Kyrian
This covenant is dependent on your partner which can make or break it’s usability. Generally you will simply bind yourself to the highest dps player in the group/raid and hope for the best.

This feels very bland to press as it’s basically a global that increases the damage of 2 people by roughly 25%, more/less one way or the other, for 10 seconds while having zero gameplay interaction. The pooled damage is used up by 20% of damage done, healing done and damage taken over 20 seconds.
Many players feel that essentially giving another player a part of your dps is unfun in addition to the ability already being bland. Assuming both players deal the same amount of dps it’s the best single target option, getting better when the other person deals more damage.
The pool being used up by taking damage or passive healing adds another layer of obsucrity of how much value you are actually getting.

### Necrolord
The effect buffs dots which interestingly enough includes Fury of Elune and Starfall.

You can have a maximum of two debuffs on any targets at any time with just one being more common meaning that it has no scaling above two targets allowing for anything that does scale with more targets to quickly outscale it.

As the hot or dot increase is the same for all Druid specs and Balance Druid currently has the weakest dots, this ability can't be good for Moonkin without being potentially broken for other Druid specs.

### Night Fae
Very volatile ability that as a whole has found the most positive reception in terms of gameplay.

The non spec specific casts heavily depend on your surroundings. At range, and without any injured allies, and under the assumption it casts 13 spells as it currently does due to a bug, you end up with ~11.5 damage casts. Going into melee replaces 3-4 Balance Druid spells with Feral spells which deal close to no damage effectively reducing its value by ~30%. Having more injured allies which is usually the case in dungeons and raids replaces another ~2 Balance Druid spells with healing casts. In the worst case that means an unfavorable situation halves the potential damage of a Convoke cast.

The value of this ability lies in its high amount of single target burst but at the same time it has very little AoE value. The extra Starfall or Starsurges are not very useful as discussed in the earlier Starfall section. 

It currently has no smart targeting meaning you cannot focus anything if there are any additional targets present and can hit immune targets which heavily diminishes its value.

### Venthyr
A basically passive macro and forget ability that buffs your Celestial Alignment or Incarnation.

While boring this ability has the upside of always being useful as it simply buffs your damage. Heavily plays into the problem of Wrath quickly hitting the gcd cap. Even with 0% Haste you hit the gcd cap in only 6 casts during Bloodlust. 

Further forces a significant amount of your damage into our cooldown window every 3 minutes which makes the other 2:40 min feel even worse than it already does.
At higher ranks the conduit that increases our crit chance with each cast will make us go over 100% crit especially with various base crit increases like Incarnation.

The potential downside of taking damage and being stunned seems out of place considering no other covenant ability has a negative effect, and for a flavor effect it is way too dangerous. With high stacks it can nearly one shot you in the worst case.

## Legendaries

### Balance of All Things

Unique legendary that has a relevant impact on your rotation but heavily simplifies it. The resulting playstyle consists of casting fillers for about 15 seconds and then casting 3 Starsurges ad infinitum for single target but has no impact on the rotation in AoE.

Creates haste breakpoints in single target due to being able to fit in more starsurges in the one second buff windows and caps how much astral power generation is worth between the crit windows as getting any more than going to 90+ astral power again have heavily reduced value.

Very, very heavily reduces the value of crit making it by far our worst stat with this legendary.

Due to various changes this is now the best legi in all situations.

Has anti-synergy with our cooldowns which always feels bad.

### Oneth’s Clear Vision

An copied Legendary from Legion with a nerfed proc chance in addition to spenders not being as strong anymore.

If tuned well enough it will have a positive impact on the rotation as it had in Legion.

Outclassed in all aspects by nearly all other Legendaries in all scenarios. On single target the Starfall is only useful with Stellar Drift which you wouldn’t take on a single target encounter. In AoE the Starsurge has very little value and due to the high Astral Power cost of Starfall you get very few procs.

As long as the vast cost difference between Starfall and Starsurge exists this will only be good on single target.

### Primordial Arcanic Pulsar 

Has the upside of always having some value since it now works off Astral Power spent.

If it extends Celestial Alignment or Incarnation it has very good value due to Starsurge Empowerments, but otherwise has anti-synergy with it since it resets all stacks upon entering and only last 9 seconds compared to the standard 15 seconds.

Due to various nerfs to our cooldowns and mastery it is now in a fairly bad state.

### Timeworn Dreambinder

Significantly changes your playstyle on single target as you try to keep up the buff. It is possible to keep up the buff at all times with low haste already so there is no high skill floor like it used to have in Legion.

Especially due to the nerfs to spender damage, it has lost a lot of value and has anti-synergy with the Starsurge Empowerments making it fall off.

Completely useless in AoE as it is impossible to keep up the buff when you can only cast Starfall every 10 seconds.

### Final thoughts on Balance legendaries

Dreambinder and Oneth's will only ever be good on single target and if Balance of All Things isn't tuned heavily above the other options it will also be a single target legendary as it synergizes more with Starsurge dumping than our consistent AoE damage pattern with Starfall and dots. This means the only legendary that really works and feels good any time you Starfall (which is any time you fight more than 1 target) is Pulsar.
The reason it is this way stems from the vast cost difference of our spenders and being unable to use multiple Starfalls within a short timeframe. The only real fix for this is to change Starfall so it once again works with these legendaries or redesign the legendaries.

## Conduits

These are oddly or not completely tuned. Fury of the Skies allows dots to be of use even with current tuning.

### Deep Allegiance (Kyrian)

At earlier ranks can be a dps loss due to desyncing with common one and two minute cds.

### Endless Thirst (Venthyr)

Very strong but as mentioned in the Venthyr section can cause an overcap of Crit.

### Evolved Swarm (Necrolord)

Our dots being weak means this is weak as well.

### Conflux of Elements (Night Fae)

Simple damage increase with the only caveat being that dots and Starfall cast by Convoke are not affected by it as most their damage comes after the channel.

## Bugs

This will repeat some earlier mentioned bugs.

Solar Eclipse does not reduce the GCD of Wrath further than 0.75s even though its effect is meant to do so as shown by other specs. For example Elemental Shamans Storm Elemental Lightning Bolt cast time reduction.

Convoke the Spirits will only cast healing spells if you are further than 40yd from the target, even if the target is in range of the rest of your spells.

Rebirth revives with 60% of max hp instead of the 100% it should with rank 2 Rebirth.

Starfall and Fury of Elune are not affected by Circle of Life and Death legendary, despite it counting as a periodic effect for Adaptive Swarm. Functionally this could be intended but is inconsistent.

~~Convoke the Spirits casts 13 instead of 12 spells since its tick rate is 0.333.~~ Fixed

~~Endless Thirst (venthyr potency) grants 20% Crit per stack, not 2% at base level making it hard to get an accurate picture of how Venthyr actually performs during testing.~~ Fixed

~~Arcanic Pulsar procs with Incarnation give you 100% crit instead of 10%.~~ Fixed

~~Balance of All Things buff application is delayed and only applied after a queued instant spell such as Starsurge.~~ Fixed

~~Door of Shadows cannot be cast while moving with Stellar Drift.~~ Fixed
