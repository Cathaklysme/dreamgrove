<b>Notes</b>

Taloc is a mostly single target fight with medium movement and an intermission phase where you must deal with a priority add and multiple spread adds. Warrior of Elune can be a good choice over Treants if you are having trouble with movement. Twin Moons can be a good choice if you decide to kill the exploding blobs in intermission.
