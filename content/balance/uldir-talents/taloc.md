Streaking Stars / Laser Matrix / Thunderous Blast


<b>Notes</b>

Taloc is primarily a single target fight with some minor add focus and medium to heavy movement. Use 
Tiger Dash or Wild Charge to place your Plasmic Discharge in appropriate places. Treants/Warrior of Elune
and Twin Moons/Stellar Flare are purely flavor picks on this fight. Trees offer more single target while Warrior of Elune 
provides more burst during the intermission.
