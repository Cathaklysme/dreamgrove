## Heroic
{{< talents spec="balance" patch="8.1" recommend="332,213,223,222,133,133,321" >}}

<b>Notes</b>

A single target fight with two burst intermissions with priority targets and multiple add spawns. Warrior of Elune is recommended to help deal with movement and give more AoE burst. Tiger Dash can be talented if you have trouble running out of the raid with Imminent Ruin.

Run Starlord if you're capable of utilizing it well.

## Mythic
{{< talents spec="balance" patch="8.1" recommend="332,213,223,222,133,123,231" >}}

<b>Notes</b>

Warrior of Elune syncs well with parts of the fight and allows for bursts of movement when needed. Fury of Elune is very strong for dealing with the boss add spawn and the stacked Visions of Madness. Save your first Incarnation for one of the boss adds that spawns early into the fight, and plan your cooldowns from there for when your guild needs them most. Shooting Stars can be a better choice depending on your strategy and depending on how much you can benefit from Fury of Elune.

Run Starlord if you're capable of utilizing it well.
