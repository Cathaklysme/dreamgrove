## Heroic
{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="132,213,232,113,133,131,322" >}}

<b>Azerite</b>
  
Streaking Stars / Lively Spirit / Laser Matrix

<b>Notes</b>

A single target fight with two burst intermissions with priority targets and multiple add spawns. 
Warrior of Elune is recommended to help deal with movement and give more AoE burst. Tiger Dash 
can be talented if you have trouble running out of the raid with Imminent Ruin.
