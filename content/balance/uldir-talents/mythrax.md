<b>Azerite</b>
  
Streaking Stars / Laser Matrix / Archive of the Titans

<b>Notes</b>

A single target fight with two burst intermissions with priority targets and multiple add spawns. Warrior of Elune is recommended to help deal with movement and give more AoE burst. Tiger Dash can be talented if you have trouble running out of the raid with Imminent Ruin.

Streaking Stars / Laser Matrix / Archive of the Titans

<b>Notes</b>

Warrior of Elune syncs well with parts of the fight and allows for bursts of movement when needed. Fury of Elune is very strong for dealing with the boss add spawn and the stacked Visions of Madness.
