## Heroic
{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="123,213,232,213,123,131,332" >}}

<b>Azerite</b>
  
Streaking Stars / Laser Matrix / Thunderous Blast / Power of the Moon


<b>Notes</b>

A fight with huge periods of downtime due to the winds mechanic. The normal single target talents should be ran here, with heavy pooling before the winds come out. If you're having trouble with winds you can take Warrior of Elune.
