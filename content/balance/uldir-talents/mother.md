Streaking Stars / Laser Matrix / Thunderous Blast / Power of the Moon


<b>Notes</b>

Boss side: If you are assigned to the boss for the majority of the encounter, run pure single target
with the exception of Warrior of Elune over Force of Nature to help with the movement required. Consider
Stellar Drift and place one Starfall down for every set of winds (40~ second intervals). We value Incarnation 
on this fight due to the extended 100% damage taken phase at the end of the encounter.

Add duty: If you are sent over quickly and are meant to be add focused, take Warrior of Elune and Twin Moons 
without a doubt to best assist your cleave damage.
