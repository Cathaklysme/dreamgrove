If on Adds: Power of the Moon

<b>Notes</b>

Fetid is a Patchwerk fight with target swapping to blobs that are required to die. If you are struggling with the blobs living, then Force of Nature is recommended, however if you are struggling with movement then Warrior of Elune is recommended. You will want to lust around 50% and Incarnation: Chosen of Elune is very strong due to the extended burst phase. Use Wild Charge to negate the knockback the boss casts.
