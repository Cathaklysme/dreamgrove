<b>Notes</b>

On heroic, Zul is largely a mass AoE fight. You focus adds in a particular 
order (Caster>Tank Add>Crawgs) but can keep all targets DoTed and Starfall 
down them for most of Phase 1. Use Tiger Dash to move to soak locations quickly in
P1 and P2. Knockbacks, roots, and stuns, can be used on the casters and the 
crawgs.

P2 turns Zul into a single target burn. If you are not struggling to make it out
of P1, consider talenting Incarnation to best finish out the fight with a strong 
burst phase during Bloodlust.
