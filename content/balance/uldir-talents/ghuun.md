Streaking Stars / Lively Spirit / Laser Matrix

<b>Notes</b>

A spread AoE fight turned into a single target dps check with light cleave. Streaking Stars is strong here as the boss has multiple damage amplification phases that you can line your cooldowns up with. There is some downtime on this fight as you will be doing mechanics that take your attention away from doing damage to the boss and adds. Tiger Dash is exceptionally powerful on this fight as you must cover long distances quickly.
