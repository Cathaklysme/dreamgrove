Streaking Stars / Laser Matrix / Archive of the Titans

<b>Notes</b>

A spread AoE fight turned into a single target dps check with light cleave. Streaking Stars is strong here as the boss has multiple damage amplification phases that you can line your cooldowns up with. There is some downtime on this fight as you will be doing mechanics that take your attention away from doing damage to the boss and adds.

<b>Notes</b>

Use Incarnation with the 1st Dark Bargain, on the 1st beam that stuns G'huun, and finally use your 3rd Incarnation at the beginning of the final phase. Use Warrior of Elune to cover distances without losing damage such as when soaking boils or coming back from inserting the power matrix. Restoration Affinity is useful in keeping people alive with the incredibly high amounts of damage going out. Wild charge can be used to leap up onto the running platforms and save you a lot of crucial time.
