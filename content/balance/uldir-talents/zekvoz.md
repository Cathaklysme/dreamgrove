<b>Azerite</b>
  
Streaking Stars / Laser Matrix / Thunderous Blast

Power of the Moon / Lunar Shrapnel
(If you need add damage and are not getting a P3 buff)

<b>Notes</b>

A three phase fight split into burst add cleave, split priority target focus, and finally a single target burn. 
We recommend Incarnation for bursting down the add spawns and for the final phase single target burn. 
Solar Beam and Mighty Bash work on the P2 caster minions and Typhoon can knock back the melee adds in P1. 
Sort out which of these abilities will best help your raid by speaking with your Raid Leader.
