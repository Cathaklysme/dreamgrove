## Heroic
{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="123,313,232,223,133,123,312" >}}

<b>Azerite</b>
  
Streaking Stars / Laser Matrix / Thunderous Blast

If you need add damage and are not getting a P3 buff

Power of the Moon / Lunar Shrapnel

<b>Notes</b>

A three phase fight split into burst add cleave, split priority target focus, and finally a single target burn.
Depending on what your raid is lacking, you can choose Soul of the Forest for P1 add focus, or Incarnation for the P3 burn.
Solar Beam and Mighty Bash work on the P2 caster minions and Typhoon can knock back the melee adds in P1. Sort out 
which of these abilities will best help your raid by speaking with your Raid Leader.
