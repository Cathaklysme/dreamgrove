## Heroic
 
{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="223,312,232,222,133,131,232" >}}

<b>Azerite</b>
  
Power of the Moon / Streaking Stars / Laser Matrix

<b>Notes</b>
 
A single target fight that spawns a high priorty add that needs to be cleaved down periodically throughout the fight. There is guaranteed downtime on Vectis through the mechanics of the fight, making Incarnation and Fury of Elune more powerful than usual. The t15 row is purely personal preference as all talents are viable for this fight.
