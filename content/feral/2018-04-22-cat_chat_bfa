Ferals!
We have decided to ~~totally rip off the boomkins~~ create an ongoing, probably monthly, chat between Me [Guiltyas], Xanzara and joined this month by special guest Night!

We intend to cover a wide array of feral-related topics and hopefully create good discussion/share our thoughts on any relevant feral news. This is our second episode, where we discuss the (small number) of BFA changes coming to feral, what we think about them, issues we see with the current design, and what we'd like to see going forwards!
