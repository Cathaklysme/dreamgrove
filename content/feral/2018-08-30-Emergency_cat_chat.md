In this (emergency) Cat Chat Xanzar and Guiltyas discuss the 5 minute old feral hotfixes and their notes for the future. 

To stress, we should be gratefull we got these changes. It's exceedingly rare that blizzard make Mechanical changes in hotfixes so this is a good sign that they are listening and paying attention. Number tuning will come with Heroic Week.
